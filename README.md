## Location Map

Takes a list of locations and creates pins on a map based on lat/long coordinates.

Each pin, when clicked, opens a detail modal for the location.

Each location has basic information:

1. Address
2. Phone #
3. Website

User can enter their location in a search field and zoom in on a portion of the map closest to their location.

There is also a text list of locations. List updates when user enters address, showing nearby locations only.
